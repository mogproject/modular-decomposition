# modular-decomposition

Graph modular decomposition implemented with C++ and Python 3. 

The code implements the algorithm described in *Simpler, Linear-Time Modular Decomposition via Recursive Factorizing Permutations*
by Marc Tedder, Derek Corneil, Michel Habib, and Christophe Paul (appeared at [ICALP 2008](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70575-8_52)).
